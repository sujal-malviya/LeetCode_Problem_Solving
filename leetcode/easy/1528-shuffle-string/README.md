# Shuffle String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the  **same length**. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `ith` position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return  *the shuffled string*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- s.length == indices.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 100
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.
- 0 <= indices[i] < n
- All values of indices are unique.

class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        char[] result = new char[s.length()];

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            result[indices[i]] = s.charAt(i);
        }

        return new String(result);
    }
}
```
