# Reverse String II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= k <= 104

    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2 * k) {
            int left = i;
            int right = Math.min(i + k - 1, arr.length - 1);

            while (left < right) {
                char temp = arr[left];
                arr[left] = arr[right];
                arr[right] = temp;

                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }

        return new String(arr);
    }
}
```
