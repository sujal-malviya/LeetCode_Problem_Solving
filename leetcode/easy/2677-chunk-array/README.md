# Chunk Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array `arr` and a chunk size `size`, return a  **chunked**  array.

A  **chunked**  array contains the original elements in `arr`, but consists of subarrays each of length `size`. The length of the last subarray may be less than `size` if `arr.length` is not evenly divisible by `size`.

Please solve it without using lodash's `_.chunk` function.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], size = 1
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays each with 1 element.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: arr = [1,9,6,3,2], size = 3
Output: [[1,9,6],[3,2]]
Explanation: The arr has been split into subarrays with 3 elements. However, only two elements are left for the 2nd subarray.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: arr = [8,5,3,2,6], size = 6
Output: [[8,5,3,2,6]]
Explanation: Size is greater than arr.length thus all elements are in the first subarray.

```

 **Example 4:** 

```
Input: arr = [], size = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no elements to be chunked so an empty array is returned.
```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- arr is a string representing the array.
- 2 <= arr.length <= 105
- 1 <= size <= arr.length + 1

```js
/**
 * @param {Array} arr
 * @param {number} size
 * @return {Array}
 */
var chunk = function(arr, size) {
    

    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {
        result.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));
    }

    return result;

};

```
